# Chapter 5 - Fundamental development workflows {#Chap5}

This chapter discusses the basic workflow of developing an R package.

## survey the existing landscape

Is your idea package worthy? Why do you want to create a package?

Appreciating two payoffs can help in answering these questions:
1) Product - this package will make your/others lives easier/better
2) Process - Getting a greater appreciation and mastery of R

By understanding the existing landscape you can get an appreciation of any common conventions that might be in a community, any existing packages that may already do what you want. If your package is in a well defined domain, ensuring you fit within conventions can help uptake and compatability with other packages/ecosystems (e.g. tidymodels).

## naming your package
Its hard!

Three formal requirements:
1) Can only have letters, numbers and fullstops
2) It must start with a letter
3) It can't end with a full stop

No hyphens, underscores. It is best to avoid having a fullstop if possible.
Tips:
* Pick a unique name that is easy to google
* don't use an existing R/bioconductor name - check github for anything that may be in development
* avoid using both upper and lower case letters
* lean towards pronounceable names
* Find a word that evokes a problem and modify it to be unique
* use abbreviations
* add an extra R
* don't get sued:
** rDrop isnâ€™t called rDropbox because Dropbox prohibits any applications from using the full trademarked name

The available package can help evaluate a particular name

## Package creation

There are two ways to create a package.
* call `usethis::create_package`
* in RStudio, do File > New Project > New Directory > R Package (this actually just calls usethis anyway)

This produces the minimum viable package structure with the following components:
1) An `R/` directory
2) A basic `DESCRIPTION` file
3) A basic `NAMESPACE` file

It can also include an Rstudio project file, pkgname.Rproj
